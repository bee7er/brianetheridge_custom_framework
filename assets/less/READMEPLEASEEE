Making changes to the CSS.

do NOT edit the .css file!!


Option 1 (recommended)

Just drag and drop your entire dev folder into it, and remember to have the app open when you make LESS changes.

As you save your .less files it compiles them all for you on the fly, you dont have to worry about a thing.

Commit the CSS and LESS files.



Option 2 (some things might not work this way!)

replace this line: 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/less/style.css">

with 
<link rel="stylesheet/less" href="assets/less/style.less">
<script src="assets/js/libs/less-1.3.0.min.js"></script> 

This will use the javascript to compile the CSS. 
Not all features are supported though so it could be troublesome.
